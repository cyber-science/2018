INTRODUCTION
=============

Over the last fifty years, computational intelligence has evolved from logic-based artificial intelligence, nature-inspired soft computing, and social-oriented agent technology to cyber-physical integrated ubiquitous intelligence towards Pervasive Intelligence (PI). The International Conference on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing is intended to cover all kinds of these intelligent paradigms as well as their applications in various pervasive computing domains. PICom-2018 is the conference on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, previously held as PCC (Las Vegas, USA, 2003 and 2004), PSC (Las Vegas, USA, 2005), PCAC (Vienna, Austria, 2006, and Niagara Falls, Canada, 2007), IPC-2007 (Jeju, Korea, December 2007), IPC-2008 (Sydney, Australia, December 2008), and since 2009 as the name PICom. IEEE PICom 2018 will be held on 12-15 August 2018 in Athens, Greece, co-located with IEEE CyberSciTech 2018, IEEE DASC 2018 and DataCom 2018. It aims to bring together computer scientists and engineers, to discuss and exchange experimental and theoretical results, work-in-progress, novel designs, and test-environments or test-beds in the important areas of Pervasive Intelligence and Computing.

PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINE
==========================

Authors are invited to submit their original research work that has not previously been published or under review in any other venue. Papers should be prepared in IEEE CS Proceedings format and submitted via EDAS systems (https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=24494). Research papers should explore a specific technology problem and propose a complete solution to it, with experimental results. A regular (full) paper is between 6-8 pages. A WiP, workshop, or special session paper should be between 4-6 pages and a poster paper should be between 2-4 pages. Some papers originally submitted as full can be accepted as short papers or posters during the review process. In such cases, the authors will need to reduce the paper accordingly when preparing the camera-ready version. At least one of the authors of any accepted paper is requested to register and present the paper at the conference. 



SPECIAL ISSUES 
========================== 
Extended versions of selected excellent papers will be considered for fast-track publication in regular or special issues of prestigious journals. The following journals are already confirmed:

1 - Information Fusion - Elsevier - Impact Factor: 5.667 (https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-fusion/) 
2 - World Wide Web journal - Springer (www.Springer.com/11280 ) -  Special Issue on Smart Computing and Cyber Technology for Cyberization 
3 - MDPI Sensors (http://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/Pervasive_Intelligence_Computing) -  Special Issue on "Pervasive Intelligence and Computing"

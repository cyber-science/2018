                - <b>The First International Workshop on Healthcare with Intelligent Sensing, System, and Data (HISSD)</b>: <a href="assets/docs/SS_HISSD_CFP.pdf">CFP</a><br/>
                As health systems are under pressure due to aging population and the incidence of various health conditions, intelligent technology can provide innovative products, services, and processes to enable people to be active, healthy, and independent for longer period of time.<br/><br/>
                The objective of the workshop is to bring together multidisciplinary contributors among academic and industrial researchers in the field of sensing, communication, machine learning, human-centred design, and healthcare providers to identify, discuss and present technical challenges and recent results/developments related to the human activity sensing, recognition and its applications, and other monitoring devices/systems for healthcare. Despite being a very multidisciplinary area, expertise and opportunities for academic exchanges are often sectorial and limited to specific aspects of the whole scenario, like the sensor or the data processing. On the contrary, in this workshop we aim to bring together a diverse audience with a mixture of backgrounds related to the general field of sensing, systems, and data for healthcare, to foster interaction and promotion of new approaches.<br/><br/>

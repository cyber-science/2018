                <b>Abstract</b>: Recent years have seen a growing interest among users in the migration of their applications to the Cloud computing environments. However, due to high complexity, Cloud-based services often experience a large number of failures and security breaches, and consequently, impose numerous challenges on the dependability and resilience of users’ applications. Unfortunately, current dependability and resilience solutions focus either on the infrastructure itself or on application analysis, but fail to consider the complex inter-dependencies between system components and application tasks. This aspect is highly crucial especially when Cloud environments are used, as it is increasingly considered nowadays, in critical applications. Besides, definition of application requirements, allocations of resources to application tasks, and optimization of global management parameters usually are based either on statistical approaches or on heuristics strategies typical of operating research. Computational intelligence may give additional opportunities and flexibility in specifying the requirements especially when they are defined by non-experts and in optimizing the resource allocation and the global management parameters. This talk will discuss a user-centric, dependability- and resilience-driven framework that considers deploying and protecting users’ applications in the Cloud infrastructure so as to minimize their exposure to the vulnerabilities in the network, as well as offering fault tolerance and resilience as a service to the users who need to deploy their applications in the Cloud. In this scenario, the talk analyzes the opportunities offered by computational intelligence to specify the characteristics and the requirements of these environments and support their management in the presence of many local optimization minima.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: New-generation operating systems for network computing are facing challenges for providing efficient and secure services. Unfortunately, many users still hesitate to embrace this brand-new network computing services due to their lack of trust in such kind of services. For building a strong mutual trust among service providers and users, we propose to require service providers and users to sign bilateral cleanroom security agreements to ensure that only such software associated with such agreements are executable on service providers and/or user clients. We present a cleanroom computing and cleanroom security approach to monitor software streams flowing from software repositories to servers and/or clients, and to keep those cleanroom security agreements tamper-proof. We also present a runtime cleanroom framework for securing software execution based on hardware-assisted integrity verification and cryptographic techniques. Research results provide significant theoretical and practical supports in building efficient and secure new-generation operating systems for network computing.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: Effective use of data management techniques for the analysis and visualization of massive data models is crucial for the success of any supercomputing center, for creating a data-intensive scientific investigation cyberinfrastructure, and for a growing number of industrial endeavors. As exascale computing progresses, data movement challenges have fostered innovation leading to complex streaming workflows which take advantage of being able to process in-motion data.  This technology is also being used to more broadly investigate sensing data and is being deployed in commercial products, with direct economic and societal impact.The techniques developed at the Center for Extreme Data Management Analysis and Visualization (CEDMAV) allow for the building of a scalable data movement infrastructure for fast I/O while organizing the data in a way that makes it immediately accessible for analytics and visualization. In this talk I will share not only these techniques, but also a topological analytics framework that allows for processing data in-situ and for achieving massive data reductions while maintaining the ability to explore the full parameter space for a featured selection. Overall, this technological innovation leads to a flexible data streaming workflow that allows for working with massive simulation models without compromising the interactive nature of the exploratory process that is characteristic of the most effective data analytics and visualization environment.   These data streaming technologies are increasingly useful in experimental facilities, e.g., microscopes used in neuroscientific research, and synchrotron light sources for materials science. The distributed deployment of these technologies is poised to provide cost effective solutions in fields such as precision agriculture, surveillance, telemedicine, and many others as well.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: The integration of existing and future smart cyberphysical systems within a fully realized Internet of Things (IoT) cannot dismiss the requirement of interoperability. The absence of standards for the IoT along with its intrinsic complexity demand for proper methodologies in order to fully support the development of heterogeneous, but interoperable, IoT systems as well as their integration. However, at the state-of-the-art, no methodologies for IoT systems integration are available. To fill this gap, in this keynote, the INTER-METH engineering methodology is presented. Developed in the context of the European H2020 project named INTER-IoT (http://www.inter-iot-project.eu/), INTER-METH supports the integration process of heterogeneous IoT platforms from the analysis to the maintenance phase. Its main features as well as its abstract and instantiated process schema are described; in particular, in this talk the focus will be on the analysis and design phase that are fundamental for driving the integration process. Moreover, we also describe a purposely developed tool supporting the application of INTER-METH, named INTER-CASE. Specifically, the application of INTER-CASE in the domain of INTER-HEALTH, a main use case of INTER-IoT, will be discussed.<br/><br/>

                <b>Abstract</b>: The Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) are the integration of computation, communication and control with the physical world, human knowledge and sociocultural elements. It is a novel emerging computing paradigm and has attracted wide concerns from both industry and academia in recent years. Currently, CPSS are still in their infancy stage. Our first ongoing research is to study effective and efficient approaches for CPSS modeling and general system design automation methods, as well as methods analyzing and/or improving their power and energy, security, trust and reliability features. Once the CPSS have been designed, they collect massive data (Volume) from the physical world by various physical perception devices (Variety) in structured/semi-structured/unstructured format and respond the users’ requirements immediately (Velocity) and provide the proactive services (Veracity) for them in physical space or social space. These collected big data are normally high dimensional, redundant and noisy, and many beyond the processing capacity of the computer systems. Our second ongoing research is focused on the Data-as-a-Service framework, which includes data representation, dimensionality reduction, incremental and distributed processing (securely on cloud), deep learning, clustering, prediction and proactive services, aiming at representing and processing big data generated from CPSS, providing more valued smart services for human and refining the previously designed CPSS. This talk will present corresponding case studies in some applications to demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed system design methodology and analytic framework.<br/><br/>

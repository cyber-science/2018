The 3rd IEEE Cyber Science and Technology Congress (CyberSciTech 2018) 
http://cyber-science.org/2018/ 
Athens, Greece, 12-15 August 2018

Cyber Science for Cyber-enabled New Worlds

INTRODUCTION
---------------------
The modern digitized world has led to the emergence of a new paradigm on global information networks and infrastructures known as Cyberspace, which bring seamless integration of physical, social and mental spaces. Cyberspace is becoming an integral part of our daily life from learning and entertainment to business and cultural activities.

To address these emerging challenges, there is a need to establish new science and research portfolios that incorporate cyber-physical, cyber-social and cyber-mental technologies together in a coherent manner to deliver the vision of Cyberspace. This is the aim of the IEEE Cyber Science and Technology Congress (CyberSciTech), which was successfully held first in Auckland (New Zealand) in 2016 and then in Orlando (USA) in 2017. 

IEEE CyberSciTech 2018 is to continually offer a common platform for scientists, researchers and engineers to share their latest ideas and to exchange the latest developments and outcomes in their research and technologies, with a broad scope of cyber-related science, technology and application topics to understand and shape cyber-enabled new worlds.
